# Portfolio Visualizations

This project showcases interactive mockups and visualizations of various product management projects I've worked on. The visualizations are designed to demonstrate UX concepts, user flows, and key features without requiring backend functionality.

## Current Visualizations

### Control Hub
A mockup of a centralized internal tool platform that unified scattered tools at Hubs.com, creating a single access point for critical workflows. Features include:

- Universal "Quest" search for finding orders, quotes, and other items
- Interactive sidebar navigation between different tools
- Mock order details view with comprehensive information
- Contextual guidance through an interactive chat bubble

## Upcoming Visualizations

- **Supplier Hub**: An integrated platform for managing suppliers and capabilities
- **Zip File Uploader**: A specialized tool for batch processing manufacturing files
- **Quote Builder**: An interactive quote creation tool with real-time pricing

## Tech Stack

This project is built with:

- **Next.js**: For the frontend framework
- **React**: For the component-based UI
- **TypeScript**: For type safety
- **CSS Modules**: For component-specific styling
